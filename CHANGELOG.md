## 0.14.0 (2024-03-28)

extension signing. For an example of how to configure it,
[see `tmkms.toml.example`](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms/blob/621bd41/tmkms.toml.example#L19).

### Changed
- Bump tendermint-rs crates to v0.19 ([#327])

[#327]: https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms/pull/327


## 0.10.0 (2021-02-16)

This release is compatible with [tendermint v0.34] or older.

It includes initial support for "Stargate", an upgrade to Cosmos Hub which
will enable IBC. It also retains backwards compatibility for all older versions
of Tendermint via the `[validator.protocol_version]` setting in `tmkms.toml`.

For Stargate, configure this value to:

```toml
[[validator]]
chain_id = "cosmoshub-4"
protocol_version = "v0.34"
state_file = "/path/to/cosmoshub-4-state.json"
```

Also make sure to update the `state_file` with a new filename
(e.g. `cosmoshub-4-state.json`) and retain the old state file for `cosmoshub-3`.
You'll need the old state file if a chain rollback is required!

### Added
- Tendermint v0.34 signing compatibility ([#211])

### Changed
- rpc: add support for protobuf-encoded messages ([#201])
- tx-signer: retry failed transactions up to 3 times ([#213])
- Use `consensus::State` serializers from `tendermint-rs` ([#232])
- Use `tendermint-p2p` crate for secret connection ([#234], [#290])
- Bump `stdtx` to v0.4 ([#249])
- Bump `tendermint-rs` to v0.18 ([#290])
- Bump `tokio` to v1.0 ([#290])
- Bump `yubihsm` crate dependency to v0.38 ([#289])
- MSRV 1.46+ ([#249])

## 0.9.0 (2020-10-22)

This release is compatible with [tendermint v0.33] or older.

It's primarily a maintenance release containing dependency upgrades as well as
a small number of breaking changes.

While it contains preliminary work to support newer versions (e.g. Stargate),
this work is in a partial/incomplete state and it is *NOT* yet compatible.
We intend to have full Stargate (Tendermint v0.34) support in the *next*
release (v0.10).

Notable breaking changes:

- The `ledgertm` cargo feature has been renamed to `ledger`
- The `protocol_version` field of `[[validator]]` is now mandatory.
  Please set it to `legacy` if it was omitted before.
- The JSONRPC format used by `tx-signer` has changed. Please see `README.txsigner.md`.

### Added
- HTTPS support ([#188])
- `tx-signer`: JSONRPC request params ([#170])

### Changed
- Rename `ledgertm` Cargo feature to `ledger` ([#186])
- Vendor the `signatory-ledger-tm` crate into the tmkms app ([#186])
- Bump dependencies ([#104], [#115], [#121], [#122], [#183], [#184]
- `tx-signer`: logging improvements ([#146], [#152], [#154], [#167], [#177])
- `tx-signer`: use `broadcast_tx_commit` instead of `broadcast_tx_sync` ([#165])
- `tx-signer`: include signer's public key in transaction ([#148])

### Fixed
- `tx-signer`: error and sequence number handling ([#181], [#178], [#168])
- Bogus secret connection identity key handling - non-security-critical bug ([#164])

This release is tested against [tendermint v0.31] and known to be compatible

### Upgrade Notes

#### `state_file` syntax changes

The validator state files use an incompatible syntax from Tendermint KMS v0.5.
It has been changed to match the conventions used by the rest of Tendermint,
where integer values are stored in strings rather than JSON integers.

When upgrading, you will need to either *delete existing state files* 
(they will be recreated automatically), or ensure the integer `height` and
`round` fields contained within these files are quoted in strings, e.g.
`{"height":"123456","round":"0",...}`.

#### Unknown fields now disallowed in `tmkms.toml`

The previous parser for `tmkms.toml` ignored unknown attributes in the
config file. This means it would often ignore syntax errors, spelling mistakes,
or attributes in the wrong location when parsing files.

This has been changed to explicitly reject such fields, however please be aware
if your config file contained invalid syntax, it will now be rejected by the
parser and the KMS will no longer boot.

We suggest validating the configuration in a staging or other noncritical
deployment of the KMS in order to ensure your configuration does not contain
accidental misconfigurations which were previously uncaught.

#### YubiHSM improvements

This release contains many improvements for users of the `yubihsm` backend:

- New `yubihsm-server` feature: this release includes support for the KMS
  exposing an HTTP service which is compatible with Yubico's
  `yubihsm-connector` service. This allows for concurrently administering
  a YubiHSM2 while the KMS is running, either through `tmkms yubihsm`
  (see additional notes below) or via Yubico's `yubihsm-shell`.
- Loopback support for `tmkms yubihsm`: the CLI functionality in the KMS for
  administering YubiHSMs can now be configured to connect to the KMS's
  own `yubihsm-server`. Additionally it can also be configured to use a
  different authentication key, and to prompt for a password as opposed to
  using one in the configuration file.

For more information on these changes, please see the "yubihsm-server feature"
section in the Tendermint KMS YubiHSM docs:

<https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms/blob/main/README.yubihsm.md>
